# This file specifies the list of packages your algorithm depends on. Put one package per line
#
# If your algorithm is closed to the internet (or if you want to make your algorithm load time
# to be fast), you need to specify your package dependencies in this file. You should not install
# packages in your code. You should just load them using the normal syntax: `library("<package name>")`.
#
# We support installing package in one of four ways:
#    1) Getting the latest version from CRAN. To do this put the package name on it's own line
#         Example to get algorithmia from CRAN: algorithmia
#    2) Getting an older version from CRAN. The line should look like: `-t <CRAN archive url>`
#         Example to get a previous version of algorithmia: -t https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/algorithmia_0.0.2.tar.gz
#    3) From GitHub. The line should look like this: `-g username/repo[/subdir][@ref|#pull]`
#         Example to get the most recent version from our github: -g algorithmiaio/algorithmia-r
#    4) Execute R code to install your dependencies. This should be used as a last resort. Do not change the
#       destination for these packages to ensure we can find them at runtime.
#         Example to get algorithmia from CRAN: `-e install.packages("algorithmia")`
#
# Note: we only support single full-line comments starting with '#'
#
# If any of this is unclear and you want to see just how we install R packages at compile time,
# take a look at: https://github.com/algorithmiaio/langpacks/blob/master/r/template/bin/rip.py
