============================================================================
This is the default directory for Oracle Network and Oracle Client
configuration files. You can place files such as tnsnames.ora, sqlnet.ora
and oraaccess.xml in this directory.
NOTE:
If you set an environment variable TNS_ADMIN to another directory containing
configuration files, they will be used instead of the files in this default
directory.
